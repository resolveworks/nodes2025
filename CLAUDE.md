# Workshop Context

This is a workshop about GraphRAG and the Neo4j Labs LLM Graph Builder. However, the real goal is to teach the underlying concepts and technologies that make this work, so attendees can apply these "tricks" in their own projects.

## Key Teaching Goals

- Show how to convert unstructured documents into structured graphs
- Explain the fundamentals behind GraphRAG technology
- Demonstrate the individual building blocks that can be used independently
- Focus on transferable skills and concepts, not just the specific tool

## Important Underlying Technologies to Highlight

- Structured data extraction from unstructured text
- Entity recognition and relationship extraction
- Schema extraction from text
- Semantic/similarity search
- Vector embeddings
- Knowledge graph construction
- Graph querying techniques

## Workshop Flow

- Learning about the LLM graph builder
- Extracting schema's
- Building knowledge graphs from real text
- Visualizing document structures
- Interactive exploration of the resulting graphs
- Interfacing with python

## Core Message

While we're using GraphRAG as the vehicle for learning, the real value is understanding the component technologies. Each piece (extraction, embeddings, graph structures, semantic search) is valuable on its own and can be applied to many different problems beyond just document search.

The attendees should leave understanding not just what GraphRAG is, but WHY it works and HOW each component contributes, so they can remix these concepts for their own use cases.
